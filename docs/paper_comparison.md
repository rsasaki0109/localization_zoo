# Original-Paper Comparison

> Generated: 2026-04-15T13:56:41+00:00

This document compares paper-reported metrics with the current repository defaults across each method family. Direct comparison is limited by differences in dataset windows, hardware, and metric definitions (ATE and RPE availability still differs by family).

For an explicit statement of implementation scope and what the repo currently claims to reproduce, see [`docs/reproduction_status.md`](reproduction_status.md).

## LiTAMIN2

**Paper**: Yokozuka et al., LiTAMIN2: Ultra Light LiDAR-based SLAM using Geometric Approximation Applied with KL-Divergence, ICRA 2021

**Reported dataset**: KITTI Odometry (sequences 00-10)
**Reported metric**: RPE translation [%]
**Hardware**: Intel Core i7-8700, 32GB RAM
**Repo scope**: Paper-oriented front-end reimplementation — The repo reproduces the LiTAMIN2 registration front-end and also keeps a paper-like 3 m profile inside the shared benchmark harness.
**Current claim**: Partial reproduction path — Paper-like cost terms and profiles exist, but the stored evidence is still short-window ATE under the shared evaluator rather than the paper's full-sequence KITTI RPE study.
**Numeric comparison**: Indirect only — Paper numbers and repo numbers differ in metric, evaluation window, and hardware, so the comparison is directional rather than direct.
**Main blocker**: No repository-stored full KITTI odometry sweep with the paper's reported metric is exported today.
**Next step**: Add full KITTI Odometry runs for the paper-profile variants and export RPE translation [%] alongside ATE.

**Notes**: Paper reports RPE (relative pose error), not ATE. Direct comparison with repo ATE requires caution.

## GICP

**Paper**: Segal et al., Generalized-ICP, RSS 2009

**Reported dataset**: Custom indoor/outdoor datasets
**Reported metric**: qualitative alignment quality
**Hardware**: Not specified
**Repo scope**: Compact shared implementation — The repo keeps a self-contained GICP-style registration loop with local covariance modeling under the stable evaluator.
**Current claim**: Concept-only comparison — The implementation is useful as benchmark evidence for the GICP idea, but not as a paper-result reproduction of a specific historical codebase.
**Numeric comparison**: Not direct — The original paper predates the repo's modern public benchmark suite and does not provide a standardized numeric target that can be matched one-to-one here.
**Main blocker**: There is no single paper benchmark and hardware protocol to reproduce against.
**Next step**: Choose a concrete upstream GICP benchmark target, or keep GICP explicitly scoped as conceptual baseline evidence.

**Notes**: Original GICP paper predates KITTI. No standardized numeric benchmark reported. Comparison is with the concept, not specific numbers.

## NDT

**Paper**: Biber & Strasser, The Normal Distributions Transform: A New Approach to Laser Scan Matching, IROS 2003; Magnusson, The Three-Dimensional Normal-Distributions Transform, PhD Thesis 2009

**Reported dataset**: Custom 2D/3D datasets
**Reported metric**: qualitative
**Hardware**: Not specified
**Repo scope**: Compact baseline — The repo implements an NDT-style registration baseline against voxel Gaussian models with a compact optimizer.
**Current claim**: Concept-only comparison — This path is benchmark-useful, but it is not a direct reproduction of the original NDT papers or of a single modern NDT codebase.
**Numeric comparison**: Not direct — The original papers predate KITTI-style public odometry evaluation, and modern NDT implementations use materially different code paths.
**Main blocker**: There is no agreed modern NDT reference setup wired into the repo as the reproduction target.
**Next step**: Anchor against one explicit modern NDT codebase and dataset pair if direct reproduction is required.

**Notes**: Original NDT papers predate KITTI. Modern NDT implementations (e.g., Autoware) use NDT on KITTI but those numbers are from different codebases.

## KISS-ICP

**Paper**: Vizzo et al., KISS-ICP: In Defense of Point-to-Point ICP, RAL 2023

**Reported dataset**: KITTI Odometry (sequences 00-10)
**Reported metric**: ATE [m] (mean over full sequence)
**Reported FPS**: ~100
**Hardware**: Intel Core i9-12900K
**Repo scope**: Compact baseline — The repo keeps a small KISS-ICP-style local-map pipeline that preserves the main idea while simplifying the full upstream engineering stack.
**Current claim**: Benchmark-comparable only — The current implementation is close enough for same-contract comparisons, but it should not be presented as a faithful rerun of the upstream KISS-ICP project.
**Numeric comparison**: Partial only — The paper and repo are both KITTI-oriented and ATE-like, but the repo still uses compact internals, shorter windows, and different hardware.
**Main blocker**: The public aggregates are windowed runs of the compact pipeline, not full-sequence reruns of the reference implementation.
**Next step**: Run full KITTI sequences and publish an explicit deviation sheet against the upstream KISS-ICP implementation.

### Paper-Reported Values

| Sequence | Value |
|---|---:|
| kitti_00 | 3.12 |
| kitti_01 | 10.37 |
| kitti_02 | 7.28 |

**Notes**: KISS-ICP reports near real-time performance (~100 FPS) on KITTI. ATE values are for full sequences; our 108-frame windows will differ.

## CT-ICP

**Paper**: Dellenbach et al., CT-ICP: Real-time Elastic LiDAR Odometry with Loop Closure, ICRA 2022

**Reported dataset**: KITTI Odometry (sequences 00-10)
**Reported metric**: RPE translation [%]
**Reported FPS**: ~13
**Hardware**: Intel Core i7-9700K, 64GB RAM
**Repo scope**: Paper-oriented core reimplementation — The repo implements the continuous-time two-pose-per-scan core, interpolation, and point-to-plane optimization described by CT-ICP.
**Current claim**: Core close, evaluation still indirect — The underlying formulation is near the paper core, but the exported evidence is still short-window ATE under the shared evaluator instead of the paper's full KITTI RPE study.
**Numeric comparison**: Indirect only — Metric, sequence protocol, and hardware still differ from the published study, so current numbers should not be treated as direct CT-ICP reproduction results.
**Main blocker**: The repo does not yet export the paper's full KITTI evaluation protocol and metric set.
**Next step**: Add full KITTI Odometry CT-ICP reruns with the paper-reported metric and publish side-by-side results.

### Paper-Reported Values

**Notes**: CT-ICP reports RPE, not ATE. Continuous-time formulation. Our repo measures ATE on short windows.

## CT-LIO

**Paper**: Zheng et al., Continuous-Time Fixed-Lag Smoothing for LiDAR-Inertial-Odometry (CT-LIO), IROS 2023 / derived from CT-ICP + IMU integration

**Reported dataset**: KITTI raw, NTU VIRAL, custom
**Reported metric**: ATE [m]
**Hardware**: Not standardized
**Repo scope**: Custom integration — This repo combines CT-ICP-style continuous-time interpolation with IMU preintegration as a compact local prototype built from shared components.
**Current claim**: Not comparable to a single paper — The code path is intentionally a custom integration, so its numbers should not be presented as reproduction of one upstream CT-LIO or CLINS paper result.
**Numeric comparison**: Reference-based only — The current results are useful inside the repo benchmark, but they are not direct paper-result comparisons.
**Main blocker**: There is no single paper-faithful target implementation and protocol behind this path.
**Next step**: Either keep CT-LIO explicitly custom, or add a separate faithful-track implementation with its own benchmark protocol.

### Repository Defaults

| Dataset | Variant | ATE [m] | RPE trans [%] | RPE rot [deg/m] | FPS |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| HDL-400 | Seed-only fast | 0.479 | - | - | 19.56 |
| HDL-400 | Seed-only fast | 0.488 | - | - | 17.48 |

**Notes**: CT-LIO in this repo is a custom integration. Not directly comparable to any single published paper. Reference-based comparison only.
